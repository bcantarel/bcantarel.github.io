##2016 NGS Summer BootCamp: From Alignment to differential expression analysis

####Today we are going to do:
+ Run featureCounts to get gene counts
+ Use DESeq2 to normalize data and visualization
+ Use DESeq2 to do differential expressed genes
+ Differential expressed genes filtering and draw heatmap
+ Run stringTie to get transcript-level abundance
+ Use Ballgown to visualize the transcripts and do differential analysis
