       <h3>Unix Problem Set</h3>
       <ol style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
	 <li>Log into your machine or account.</li>
	 <ol>
	   <li> Mac Users: Open the application: Terminal</li>
	   <li>From Terminal: <code>ssh -Y  username@toxea.swmed.edu</code></li>
	   <li>Windows users -- Please refer to the PuTTY instructions with your username and the server <code>toxea.swmed.edu</code></li>
	 </ol>
	 <li>Change your password to something you will remember using the command <code>passwd</code></li>
	 <li>What is the full path to your home directory?</li>
	 <li>Go up one directory?</li>
	 <ol>
           <li>How many files does it contain?</li>
           <li>How many directories?</li>
	 </ol>
	 <li>Using a text editor create a fasta file and name it sequences.fasta. Make sure it ends up in the proper directory, locally or remotely.</li>
	 <p>This is fasta file format:<br>
	   <code>
	     >seqName description<br>
	     ATGGCGTCTTGGCCTTAAAAGCTC
	   </code>
	   <li>Without using a text editor examine the contents of the file sequences.fasta.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>How many lines does this file contain?   </li>
      <li>How many characters?    (Hint: check out the options of wc)</li>
      <li>What is the first line of this file?    (Hint: read the man page of head)</li>
      <li>What are the last 3 lines?    (Hint: read the man page of tail)</li>
      <li>How many sequences are in the file?    (Hint: use grep)</li>
    </ol>
      <li>Rename sequences.fasta to something more informative of the sequences the file contains. (Hint: read the man page for mv)</li>
      <li>Create a directory called fasta.     (Hint: use mkdir)</li>
    <li>Copy the fasta file that you renamed to the fasta directory. (Hint: use cp)</li>
   <li>Verify that the file is within the fasta directory.    (Hint: use ls fasta/)</li>
    <li>Delete the the original file that you used for copying.    (Hint: use rm, be careful)</li>
    <li>Read the man page for rm and cp to find out how to remove and copy a directory.</li>
    <li>Print out your history and redirect it to a file called unixBasics.history.txt</li>
    <li>In /data/bootcamp/day3 there is a file called: /data/bootcamp/day1/edgeR.results.txt </li>
    <ol>
      <li>look at the first few lines of the file</li>
      <li>sort the file by log fold change 'logFC', from highest to lowest, and save in a new file in your directory called sorted.out</li>
      <li>sort the file (log fold change highest to lowest) then print out only the first 100 lines. Save in a file called top100.sorted.out</li>
      <li>sort the file (log fold change highest to lowest) then print out only the first 100 lines, then print only the SYMBOL column. Save in a file called top.genes.txt</li>
    </ol>
</ol>



<h3>Commands to try</h3>
<code>
  ls -l<br>
  ls -lt<br>
</code>
<p>
  you can string more than one command together with a pipe (|) , such that the output of the first command is received by the second command.
<p>     
  <code>
    ls -lt | head
  </code>
<p>
  you can string more than one command together with a semi-colon (;) , such that the commands run sequentially, but that output does not get passed into the next command.
<p>
  <code>
    date; some program command ; date
  </code>
<p>
  you can redirect the output of a command into a file
<p>
  <code>
    grep PATTERN > PATTERN.txt
  </code>
<p>
  you can append the output of a command to a file
<p>
  <code>   
    grep PATTERN2 >> PATTERN.txt
  </code>
<p>
  you can redirect stderr to a file
<p>
  <code>   
    command 2> filename
  </code>
<p>
  you can redirect the output (stdout) and stderr to a file
<p>
  <code>   
    command &> filename
  </code>
