# Upcoming Courses

## [Introduction to Python I](bicf_nanocourses/courses/python_1)
### October 19<sup>th</sup>, 26th<sup>th</sup> & November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2018
8:00 am – 5:00 pm each day, Room NG3.202

This nanocourse will introduce Python for scientific computing.  Python is an open-source, fun, easy to learn, and powerful programming language. 
With deep community support and wide ranging deployment across many domains, Python is a worthy tool for projects large and small that any computational scientist should keep on hand.

Topics for this two day (all-day) course will include:

- Basic install, setup, and IDEs
- Basic Syntax
- Conditional statements, loops, functions
- Modules, classes, scripting, debugging
- Numerical arrays/matrices (numpy/scipy)
- Data structures (pandas)
              
The course will be interactive, with lectures followed by hands-on learning and exercises.
No previous programming experience is necessary. Familiarity with basic programming/scripting concepts is helpful.

# Previous Nanocourses

## [Computational Image Analysis](bicf_nanocourses/courses/image_analysis)
### September 6<sup>th</sup> - 7<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> - 11<sup>th</sup>, 2018

This nanocourse offers an introduction to state-of-the-art computer vision methods to convert image data into quantitative information. The four-day intensive course covers image analysis fundamentals using theory lectures and hands-on computer exercises using popular image analysis programs such as ImageJ, CellProfiler and Matlab. Biomedical scientists will gain the background to (1) search for and evaluate existing image analysis software, and (2) start devising their own image analysis pipeline/software. The course will also include and "image analysis therapy" session where the class can brainstorm about each other's image analysis problems.

The course is open to any interested person at UTSW, provided they utilize imaging and are interested in computational image analysis for their research. Some background in mathematics and programming is a plus, e.g., completion of the Mathematical Foundations of Quantitative Biology course and the Matlab bootcamp.

Time: This is a four-day course that runs from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day

Class Location: Room NG3.202 on Thursday 9/6; NB2.100A on all other course days

Training Topics:

- Image Enhancement & Filtering
- Segmentation
- Object Detection & Tracking
- Colocalization
- Morphological Operators
- Machine Learning Approaches

Course Size: 15 students

Academic Credit: 2 credit hours special topics

This course is also part of the [Computational and Systems Biology curriculum](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/graduate-school/programs/phd-degrees/specialized--supplemental-phd/computational-and-systems-biology/course-descriptions.html)
