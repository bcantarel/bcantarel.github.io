### NCBI Resources for Microbiology Research

Wednesday March 28th, 2018 9am - 12pm

* [Lecture and Workbooks](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/Microbiology_Resources/General/)
* [Edirect Resources](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/Microbiology_Resources/Commandline_Tools/)

This workshop is most useful for researchers who use bacterial sequence data, including those of human pathogens or microbial communities including microbiomes. 
In this workshop you will learn how to:
* Find, browse and download genome-, gene-, protein- and nucleotide sequence read-level data for individual bacterial pathogens and metagenomes
* Access and display precomputed genome analyses and perform your own analyses of assembled and unassembled genomic data to identify organisms and genes
* Find, display and analyze microarray and sequence-based (RNA-Seq) data to investigate gene expression
* Find variants, antibiotic resistance genes and pathogenicity factors using genome- and SRA-BLAST.

The workshop ends with an optional session, where we will demonstrate command-line tools (EDirect, standalone Magic-BLAST and SRA-toolkit) that can help you to retrieve data and perform analyses of microbial data. This command-line tools session assumes a basic knowledge of the Unix/Linux environment.

### NCBI Resources for Genetic Disease Discovery and Clinical Support

Wednesday March 28th, 2018 1pm - 4pm

* [Lecture](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/ClinicalGenetics_Resources/Slides_ClinicalGenetics.pptx)
* [Workbook](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/ClinicalGenetics_Resources/Workbook_ClinicalGenetics.pdf)
* [Course Resources](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/ClinicalGenetics_Resources/)

The use of genetic testing in patient care is becoming more common in clinical practice. NCBI has long had resources for biologists to explore what is known about genetic variation, but has recently developed clinically-focused resources. This module is designed for those involved in clinical practice and/or translational research.
 
Based on a real-world case study, you will learn how to:
* Find a MedGen record with links to various literature resources to assist in clinical decision support and patient education
* Identify a relevant diagnostic genetic test and examine sample test results
* Based an identified genetic variant, explore the affected gene and gene product with regard to structure and function
* Explain the patient's disease etiology and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions

This module ends with a session where you will be given your own case study to solve.

### NCBI Resources for Genetic Variation and Gene Expression Research

Thursday March 29th, 9am-12pm

* [Lecture](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/HumanGenomics_Resources/Slides_HumanVariationExpression.pptx)
* [Workbook](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/HumanGenomics_Resources/Workbook_HumanVariationExpression.pdf)
* [EDirect](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/HumanGenomics_Resources/Workbook_EDirect.txt)
* [Course Resources](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/HumanGenomics_Resources/)

This module is for those involved in genetic variation research, and it briefly touches on gene expression resources. The module focuses on human data, but the exercises generally apply to other model eukaryotic organisms.
In this workshop you will learn how to:
* Find, view and download genomic sequence and annotation data
* Identify and view variants within a gene or genomic region, as well as variants associated with a given disease or phenotype using several NCBI variation resources
* Find and download gene expression studies with data from the GEO and SRA databases

This module ends with an optional session where we will demonstrate the command-line tools EDirect (for downloading data from NCBI databases) and SRA Toolkit (for downloading and analyzing RNA-seq and DNA-seq data). This command-line tools session assumes a basic knowledge of the Unix/Linux environment.

### NCBI Resources for Creating NIH Biosketches and Complying with the NIH Public Access Policy

Thursday March 29th, 2018 1pm-4pm

* [Lecture](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/NIHGrant_Resources/Slides_MyNCBIforNIHGranting.pptx)
* [Workshop](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/education/Mod_Workshops/2018/UTSW_March/NIHGrant_Resources/Workbook_MyNCBIforNIHGranting.pdf)

NIH supports scientists at various stages in their careers from pre-doctoral students to new- and early-career scientists with research training grants to investigators with extensive experience who run large research centers. NCBI has created an account system with My NCBI tools to assist researchers and their delegated staff with preparation of federal grant proposals and for NIH-funded grant progress reporting.
 
In this workshop you will learn how to:
* Create and efficiently use an NCBI account
* Generate a My Bibliography reference list and a SciENcv biosketch for grant proposal submissions
* Learn how to comply with the NIH Public Access Policy and manage Public Access compliance and NIH grant progress reporting

The second half of this workshop is an optional hands-on session where you can get hands-on experience with the tools with instructor-guided exercises.
