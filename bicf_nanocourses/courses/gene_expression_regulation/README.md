# [BICF](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics/) Gene Expression and Regulation

Are you interested in gene expression and regulation?  This course is designed to cover NGS sequence analysis to determine gene expression (RNASeq) and gene regulation (ChIPSeq and ATACSeq).

Topics covered will include:

* Short Read Alignments, Reference Genomes and Sequencing Technologies.
