# [BICF](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics/) Python 2 - Nanocourse

This nanocourse builds upon the progress of Python I and continues to develop capabilities for for scientific computing and advanced data analysis, including basic machine learning.  
Python is an open-source, fun, easy to learn, and powerful programming language.
With deep community support and wide ranging deployment across many domains, Python is a worthy tool for projects large and small that any computational scientist should keep on hand.

Topics for this two day (all-day, 9am to 5pm) course will include:

- Numerical arrays/matrices (numpy/scipy)
- Data structures/DataFrames (pandas)
- Plotting and Visualizing data (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Reading and Writing Data Files
- Basic Image Processing
- Basic Machine Learning (scikit-learn) 

The course will be interactive, with lectures followed by hands-on learning and exercises.
Previous programming experience is recommended, but not strickly required. Familiarity with basic programming/scripting concepts is helpful. Students will also have the opportunity to share their own technical challenges and explore as a class how python can help.
