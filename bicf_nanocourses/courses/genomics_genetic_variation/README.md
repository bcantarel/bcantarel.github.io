# [BICF](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics/) Genomics Analysis: Genetic Variation

Are you interested in genetic variation in cancer or inherited disease? Are you intested in looking for genetic risk loci? Are you interested in Immuno profiling?  This course cover variant detection, annotation and visualization.

Topics covered will include:

* Short Read Alignments, Reference Genomes and Sequencing Technologies.
* Variation Detection Tools
* Somatic and Germline Variant Priorization in Cancer, Medelian and Complex Diseases
* Population Genetics to Identify Risk Loci
* Immune Profiling using Sequence Data
