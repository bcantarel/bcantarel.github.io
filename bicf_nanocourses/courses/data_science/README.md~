# [BICF](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics/) Data Science for Biologist, R I and II

Do you want to be to do simple statistical analyses yourself? Do you find yourself spending time and effort generating the same plots and statistics for each project? R is a freely available language and programming environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.
