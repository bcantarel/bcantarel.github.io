# Student Project Ideas

*   Pick a dataset from the class or from your own work.
  * 1. Plot 2 continuous variables and add a trend lines.
  * 2. Create box-lots using a continuous variable and a categorical variable.
  * 3. Add text to indicate the mean of each group on the plot (type mtext)
  * 4. Present the summary statistics for the comparison between a continuous variable and a categorical variable.
*   With the [RNASeq Data](https://cloud.biohpc.swmed.edu/index.php/s/Q3NwRfjo5ATEjUF) used in the Demo
  * 1. Calculate logCMP from RNASeq
  * 2. Make a heatmap of the a subset of genes; chose 10 or 20 genes
  * 3. Choose 2 genes to make boxplots comparing the expression with the (see design.txt)
  * 4. Create a 3-D plots to show the expression of 3 genes.
*   Create 3 vectors using random functions for classic distributions see the [Distribution Help Page](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Distributions.html)
  * 1. Plot these vectors as histograms, cumulative distribution function and density function.
*   Pick a package in bioconductor
    * 1. Prepare 5-10 slides to show the other students in the class on how to use this function from installation to some final plot.
*   Have your own question?Â  Students who want to design their own project should send Brandi Cantarel an email on the topic.
