# [BICF](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics/) Python 1 - Nanocourse

This nanocourse will introduce Python for scientific computing.  
Python is an open-source, fun, easy to learn, and powerful programming language.
With deep community support and wide ranging deployment across many domains, Python is a worthy tool for projects large and small that any computational scientist should keep on hand.

Topics for this two day (all-day) course will include:

- Basic install, setup, and IDEs
- Basic Syntax
- Conditional statements, loops, functions
- Modules, classes, scripting, debugging
- Numerical arrays/matrices (numpy/scipy)
- Data structures (pandas)

The course will be interactive, with lectures followed by hands-on learning and exercises.
No previous programming experience is necessary. Familiarity with basic programming/scripting concepts is helpful. Students will also have the opportunity to share their own technical challenges and explore as a class how python can help.
