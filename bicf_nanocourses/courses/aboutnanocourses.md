# Why we offer nanocourses

Advances in biomedical technologies necessitate data-intensive assays and sophisticated computational infrastructure for data storage, processing, presentation and interpretation. Progress in disease diagnoses and treatments now depend on correlative analyses of multi-modal data. The Bioinformatics Core Facility’s mission is to raise awareness and competence in data analysis issues. The Bioinformatics Nanocourse Series helps to fulfill this mission.
The basic nanocourse format was introduced by Bentley and Stanford at Harvard Medical School as a format that is“…well suited for: rapid course development; educating those with limited time to devote to formal classroom experiences; and enhancing the existing curriculum with integrative, supplemental, or novel course topics.” We have adapted their model to the bioinformatics and UTSW contexts. Topics will be chosen each year as a reflection of BICF client needs, new or trending topics in the field, and feedback from across campus.

# What to expect

Each nanocourse runs for one to two days, eight hours per day, and combines didactic lectures on topical content with hands-on workshop sessions facilitated by experienced bioinformatics faculty, industry experts and BICF personnel. Participation in the workshop sessions is limited in order to provide personalized training for each participant. Due to the small class size, participation is competitive. Registration dates will be announced in advance and registrants will be admitted based on instructor-determined match between course content and participant level of experience and research need. For example, an individual who registers for a new R users course but who has some R experience may be asked to attend the novice R users course instead.
Participants will be asked to bring their own laptop and may be required to download some materials in advance. Lunch is not provided but is available at nearby campus locations. Prior to the course participants other than faculty will be asked to submit a supervisor endorsement form, acknowledging PI support for the individual to be away from their lab for those specific dates and the entire duration of the course.

# Who should attend
The nanocourse series is open to all students, postdocs, research assistants, faculty and other personnel at UT Southwestern. We will also consider registrations from individuals at other institutions on a limited basis. Acceptance into nanocourses is competitive and decisions will be based on answers to questions on the registration form. Academic credit may be available to students through the Graduate School and Postdoctoral Affairs offices.
