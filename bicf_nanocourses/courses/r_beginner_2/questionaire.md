# R Questionaire

## Basic Skills

Please consider the following questions:

1. How do you get documentation on function in R.
2. Imagine you have a vector of numbers called 'a'. 
    * How can you multiple the numbers in that vector by 2?
    * How can you determine the squares of the numbers in the vector?
3. What is the special structure of a list (compared to a vector or dataframe)?
4. Imagine if you have a dataframe, 'movies', with columns 'leading.man', 'leading.lady', 'year' and 'title'.
    * How would you create a dataframe of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks movies?
    * How would you create a list of just the year and title of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks movies?
5. Now imagine that there is another dataframe called 'quotes', with the columns 'title', 'speaker' and 'quote'.
    * How can you merge quote and movies?
