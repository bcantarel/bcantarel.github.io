# Deep Learning for Healthcare Genomics
 
This workshop teaches you how to apply deep learning to detect chromosome co-deletion and search for motifs in genomic sequences. You’ll learn how to:

- Understand the basics of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and how they work
- Apply CNNs to MRI scans of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) to determine 1p/19q chromosome co-deletion status
- Use the DragoNN toolkit to simulate genomic data and to search for motifs

Upon completion, you’ll be able to: understand how CNNs work, evaluate MRI images using CNNs, and use real regulatory genomic data to research new motifs.

### Prerequisites
Basic familiarity with deep neural networks, basic coding experience in Python or a similar language

### Frameworks
TensorFlow, Caffe, DIGITS, Theano, DragoNN

### Assessment Type
Multiple choice

### NVIDIA Deep Learning AI Resources

### What To Bring

Students will just need their own PC with an outside internet connection to access the course materials and labs, they won’t need to install special software – all of that is preloaded on the VMs.
