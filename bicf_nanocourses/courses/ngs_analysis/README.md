# [BICF](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics/) NGS Sequence Analysis

In this nanocourse on next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis, students will learn (i) the fundamentals of NGS experimental design; (ii) to use commonly used bioinformatics tools on the command-line, (iii) statistical analysis for NGS and (iv) how to visualize NGS data.  Topics will include exome or gene panel variation detection; gene expression; gene regulation analysis; single cell analysis; genome assembly; microbial genomics and gene structure; microbiomes and metagenomics; and eukaryotic genome annotation.
