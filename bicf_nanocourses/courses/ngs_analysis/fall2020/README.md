# [BICF](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/bioinformatics/) NGS Sequence Analysis

This 4 day course will cover Human NGS including sequence alignment, mutation detection, expression analysis and gene regulation.

Topics covered will include:
- Basic unix for running analysis on the command line
- Sequence Alignment
- Variant Detection in families and tumors
- Variant Prioritization to identify association with disease
- Gene Expression Analysis using RNASeq
- Gene Regulation Analysis using ChIPSeq and ATACSeq
- Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression and Regulation
