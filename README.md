### UTSW Upcoming Courses


#### [Introduction to Python I](https://bicf.pages.biohpc.swmed.edu/bicf_nanocourses/python_1)
##### October 19<sup>th</sup>, 26th<sup>th</sup> & November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2018
8:00 am – 5:00 pm each day, Room NG3.202 UTSW

This nanocourse will introduce Python for scientific computing.  Python is an open-source, fun, easy to learn, and powerful programming language. 
With deep community support and wide ranging deployment across many domains, Python is a worthy tool for projects large and small that any computational scientist should keep on hand.

Topics for this two day (all-day) course will include:

- Basic install, setup, and IDEs
- Basic Syntax
- Conditional statements, loops, functions
- Modules, classes, scripting, debugging
- Numerical arrays/matrices (numpy/scipy)
- Data structures (pandas)
              
The course will be interactive, with lectures followed by hands-on learning and exercises.
No previous programming experience is necessary. Familiarity with basic programming/scripting concepts is helpful.
